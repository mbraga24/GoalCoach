### Firebase and React + Redux Project

The following [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-js-and-redux-mastering-web-apps/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) was used to set up firebase and React. The course made use of __React Redux connect()__ to connect components to the store. However, I decided to use __React Redux Hooks__ to consume the store context instead for practice purposes. Small stylistic changes were also applied for personal preference.
